            <p>Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital and most populous city of France, with
                an estimated population of 2,148,271 residents as of 2020, in an area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles).[1]
                Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion,
                science and arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region,
                which has an estimated official 2020 population of 12,278,210, or about 18 percent of the population of France.[1]
                The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017.[4] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit
                Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore, and
                ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva.[5] Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with
                Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018.[6][7]</p>
